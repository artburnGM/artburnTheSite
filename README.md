This repository is meant to be an image, documentation, tempfiles, and other resource for [artburn.ca](https://artburn.ca), a personal website.  
Honestly, this is intended to be a fast & hopefully not-break-too-many-things portfolio/contact site tossed together with Bootstrap and likely a few other JS libraries.   
Think, like Linktree, but slicker and the only money spent is on domain registration.   
If you are seeing this, don't expect to be impressed. This is just some in-process & personal stuff.
